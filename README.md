#  Overview

Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) is an AI-based system that detects and classifies human emotions using facial expressions, speech tone, and hand gestures.  
This project combines Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for real-time emotion analysis, enabling natural and empathetic human-computer interaction.



# Features

 1. Real-time emotion recognition using webcam and microphone  
 2. Multimodal fusion (Face + Voice + Gesture) for higher accuracy  
 3.Deep learning models â€” CNN, LSTM, Transformer  
 4.React.js interface for live emotion visualization  
 5.Flask/Django backend for model inference  
 6.Emotion analytics dashboard with visual feedback  
 7.Secure and privacy-aware design

# Installation

 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition.git
cd Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition
2. Backend Setup :
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
3.Frontend Setup:
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
The React app will run at http://localhost:3000.

 Working :

1.The frontend captures real-time webcam and microphone input.

2.The backend receives this data and runs deep learning models:

CNN â†’ Facial emotion recognition

LSTM â†’ Voice-based emotion recognition

Gesture model â†’ Hand movement detection

3.The system fuses all three modalities for accurate emotion classification.

4.The detected emotion (e.g., ðŸ˜„ Happy, ðŸ˜¢ Sad, ðŸ˜  Angry) is displayed live on the interface.

Results :
Modality	Accuracy	Description
Face	, 88%	, Handles lighting and occlusion well
Voice	,86% , 	Recognizes pitch and tone variations
Gesture , 85% , 	Detects key hand positions
Multimodal Fusion, 	90%+ , 	Superior contextual accuracy


Testing :

 Unit Testing: Module-level validation

 Integration Testing: Communication between frontend and backend

System Testing: Real-time performance on different devices

 Ethical Compliance: Data privacy and consent verification



Future Enhancements :

Integration of EEG / physiological signals

Multilingual speech emotion recognition

Edge and mobile deployment

Personalized emotion profiling

Cloud scalability and API integration

Enhanced privacy and bias detection
